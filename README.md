# classification of messages as SPAM or HAM using machine learning algorithm

The popularity of mobile devices is increasing day by day as they provide a large variety of services by reducing the cost of services. Short Message Service (SMS) is considered one of the widely used communication service. However, this has led to an increase in mobile devices attacks like SMS Spam. In this paper, we present a novel approach that can detect and filter the spam messages using machine learning classification algorithms. We study the characteristics of spam messages in depth and then found features, which can efficiently filter SMS spam messages from ham messages. Our proposed approach achieved 97% true positive rate and 3% false positive rate for Na√Øve Bayes classification algorithm. 

# INFERENCE:
 Out of 29/1379 messages were classified incorrectly. This means that the algorithm classified the testing set as spam or ham with   98% accuracy. To improve the model, one might tamper with the Laplace value, collect more SMS data, or try splitting the dataset randomly into training and testing.
 The accuracy would increase as the dataset gets bigger. The more data there is to train the algorithm, the more effective it would be in predicting Spam or Ham.
